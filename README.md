## Requirements ##

- Node v8+
- puppeteer v0.13.0+

Tested on Windows with Node v5.10.1 and puppeteer v0.13.0

## Installation ##

- Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/sarfraznawaz2005/whatspup.git`
- Type `npm install`
- Type `node chat.js USERNAME`
- Scan Whatsapp QR Code once
- Wait for connection and start typing your messages :smile:

You can switch chat with another user anytime by typing on console:
`--chat USERNAME`

NOTE: `USERNAME` is supposed to be a person with whom you have already intitiated a conversation in whatsapp. In other words, we use a selector to click that user's name from conversations list.

## Options ##

You can set various options in `config.js` file.

## Issues ##

- Currently does not seem to work in invisible/headless mode (seems to be a bug in puppeteer currently). So you have to set `window` option to `true` in config.js file.
